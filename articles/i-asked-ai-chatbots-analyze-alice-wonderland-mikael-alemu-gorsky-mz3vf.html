  <div><p>Three LLM-based chatbots, same request: ‘Please perform a set of Analytical Tasks on "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland” (text is attached)’. For ChatGPT and Claude I used “download file” option in the chatbot interface, for Gemini I gave a link to a page with this text in clear text format.</p><p>Below you see the result of inquiries: first, the full text of an analytical task, then each chatbot’s answer.</p><hr><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>Alice, a curious young girl, follows a White Rabbit down a hole and enters Wonderland, a nonsensical and fantastical world. Here, she encounters peculiar characters and situations defying logic. She drinks a potion that makes her grow tall, then eats a cake that shrinks her down. At a Mad Hatter's tea party, she converses with the Hatter, a March Hare, and a Dormouse, experiencing nonsensical riddles and chaotic conversations.</p><p>Alice meets the Cheshire Cat, a mischievous feline who can disappear and reappear at will, offering cryptic advice. She plays croquet with the Queen of Hearts, a tyrannical ruler who shouts "Off with their heads!" at the slightest offense. Alice attends a trial where the Knave of Hearts is accused of stealing the Queen's tarts. The nonsensical trial tests Alice's patience and logic.</p><p>Throughout her journey, Alice encounters other strange characters like the Caterpillar who smokes a hookah and the Mock Turtle who tells a sad story. She constantly questions her identity, growing taller and smaller, feeling lost and confused. Finally, she awakens from what seems like a dream, back in the real world, pondering the fantastical adventure she experienced.</p><p>(189 words)</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>In "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," Alice, a young girl, follows a White Rabbit down a rabbit hole and finds herself in a fantastical world. Her journey through Wonderland is a series of bizarre and whimsical events. She meets strange characters like the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, and the Queen of Hearts, who represent various aspects of Victorian society. Alice navigates through confusing scenarios, such as a mad tea party, a game of croquet using flamingos as mallets, and encounters that challenge her sense of reality and identity. The story is dreamlike and surreal, blending logic with nonsense, reflecting the innocence and confusion of childhood.</p><p>(105 words)</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" begins with young Alice sitting by a riverbank with her sister. Bored, she spots a White Rabbit with a pocket watch, follows him down a rabbit hole, and finds herself in a fantastical world.</p><p>Alice's size changes frequently throughout her journey, beginning when she drinks from a bottle labeled "DRINK ME" and shrinks, then eats a cake that makes her grow enormously. These size changes allow her to enter a beautiful garden.</p><p>In Wonderland, Alice encounters numerous peculiar characters. She meets a Mouse and other creatures, participates in a "Caucus-race," and hears the Mouse's tale. She then visits the White Rabbit's house, where her size changes cause chaos.</p><p>Alice meets the Duchess and her peppered kitchen, as well as the famous Cheshire Cat, who introduces her to the Mad Hatter and March Hare. At their tea party, Alice experiences illogical conversations and riddles.</p><p>In the Queen's croquet ground, Alice witnesses the Queen of Hearts' frequent calls for executions. She protects three gardeners from beheading and plays in the unusual croquet game using flamingos as mallets and hedgehogs as balls.</p><p>The Mock Turtle and Gryphon share stories with Alice and teach her the Lobster Quadrille dance. Alice then attends the trial of the Knave of Hearts, accused of stealing tarts. The trial descends into chaos, with Alice growing larger and challenging the court's absurdity.</p><p>As the cards rise up against her, Alice awakens on the riverbank, realizing it was all a dream. The story concludes with Alice's sister imagining Alice's future, retaining her sense of wonder into adulthood.</p><p>Throughout her adventures, Alice encounters nonsensical situations, wordplay, and characters that challenge her understanding of the world. She grapples with questions of identity, logic, and the nature of reality. The dream-like quality of Wonderland allows for impossible events and conversations that often have a hidden logic or critique of Victorian society.</p><p>The story explores themes of childhood, growth, and the absurdity of adult world rules. Alice's journey can be seen as a metaphor for the confusing process of growing up and trying to make sense of the world. The characters she meets, from the anxious White Rabbit to the enigmatic Cheshire Cat, represent different aspects of personality and society.</p><p>Lewis Carroll's masterful use of language, including puns, poems, and songs, adds layers of meaning and humor to the tale. The story's enduring popularity lies in its ability to entertain children with its fantastical elements while providing deeper philosophical and social commentary for adult readers.</p><p>"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" has become a classic of children's literature, inspiring numerous adaptations and interpretations. Its influence on popular culture and literature continues to this day, with its characters and quotations widely recognized and referenced.</p><p>(451 words)</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>Representing an authoritarian figure, the Queen of Hearts embodies Victorian ideals taken to the extreme. Her temperamental outbursts and constant threats of execution reflect a society obsessed with order and control. Her dependence on shouting orders creates chaos rather than stability.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>The Queen of Hearts embodies the tyrannical authority and capriciousness of power in Victorian society. She issues harsh judgments and commands executions for trivial reasons, representing an exaggerated version of authoritarian rule. Her portrayal criticizes the arbitrary nature of power and the superficiality of societal rules.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>The Queen of Hearts represents an exaggerated and satirical view of authority in Victorian society. Her frequent calls for executions ("Off with their heads!") highlight the arbitrary and often unjust nature of power. She embodies the idea of absolute monarchy, where the ruler's whims become law. This character can be seen as a critique of the rigid class structure and unquestioned authority figures in Victorian England. The Queen's irrationality and quick temper also contrast with the ideal of the calm, rational leader, possibly commenting on the emotional suppression expected in Victorian society.</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>The Mad Hatter embodies chaotic energy. He engages in nonsensical conversations, riddles, and games, challenging logic and reason. The Cheshire Cat, on the other hand, is mischievous and cryptic. He offers riddles and observations but often disappears without providing clear answers. Both characters challenge Alice's sense of order and push her to think outside the box.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>The Mad Hatter is chaotic, whimsical, and slightly mad, embodying the absurdity and unpredictability of Wonderland. The Cheshire Cat, in contrast, is more composed, enigmatic, and philosophical, often providing cryptic advice to Alice. While the Hatter's behavior reflects the chaotic nature of Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat serves as a guide, hinting at the deeper mysteries and the flexible nature of reality. Together, they highlight Wonderland's theme of breaking down logical structures and exploring the fluidity of identity.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>The Mad Hatter and the Cheshire Cat are both eccentric characters, but they contribute to the story's themes in different ways.</p><p>The Mad Hatter embodies the nonsensical and illogical aspects of Wonderland. His riddles without answers and the endless tea party represent the absurdity of social conventions. He challenges Alice's understanding of time and logic, contributing to the theme of the breakdown of rational thought in Wonderland.</p><p>The Cheshire Cat, on the other hand, serves as a guide for Alice, albeit an enigmatic one. His ability to appear and disappear at will, leaving only his grin behind, symbolizes the elusive nature of meaning in Wonderland. The Cat's philosophical musings and observation that everyone in Wonderland is mad contribute to the theme of questioning reality and sanity.</p><p>Both characters push Alice to think beyond conventional logic, but while the Hatter confuses her, the Cat often provides cryptic insights. They represent different approaches to navigating the nonsensical world - the Hatter by fully embracing the madness, and the Cat by observing it with detached amusement.</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>Identity - Alice's journey becomes a metaphor for self-discovery. Her constant size changes symbolize the confusion and uncertainty of childhood and approaching adolescence. As she encounters strange characters, she struggles to understand who she is and where she belongs.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>Theme of Identity - Alice's sense of self undergoes constant changes as she navigates Wonderland. She experiences physical transformations, such as growing and shrinking, which mirror the internal struggles of childhood and adolescence. Throughout the story, Alice questions who she is, which represents the process of self-discovery and the fluid nature of identity.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>Identity theme -</p><p>Alice's sense of self undergoes significant changes throughout her adventures in Wonderland. At the beginning of the story, Alice is sure of who she is, but as she experiences physical changes (growing and shrinking) and encounters bizarre situations, she begins to question her identity. This is evident when she can't properly recite poems she once knew or when she wonders if she has become a different person altogether. The constant challenges to her understanding of the world force Alice to adapt and reconsider her place in it. By the end of her journey, Alice has gained confidence and is able to stand up to the absurd authority of the Queen, showing growth in her sense of self.</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>Growing and Shrinking - The constant fluctuation in Alice's size can be interpreted as the physical and emotional changes experienced during childhood and growing up. Growing tall represents a desire for control and authority, while shrinking signifies feeling powerless and vulnerable.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>Symbolism of "Growing" and "Shrinking" - The repeated motif of growing and shrinking symbolizes the challenges of childhood and the process of maturation. It reflects the awkwardness of trying to fit into a world full of rules and expectations. Alice's transformations highlight the difficulty of finding a balance between childhood innocence and the responsibilities of adulthood.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>Symbolism of growing and shrinking -</p><p>The frequent changes in Alice's size symbolize the confusing process of growing up. When Alice grows, she often finds herself too big for her surroundings, much like how children can feel awkward or out of place as they mature. Shrinking represents feelings of insignificance or powerlessness that children might experience in an adult world. The uncontrollable nature of these changes reflects the unpredictability of growing up. Additionally, the act of Alice having to adapt to her new sizes mirrors how children must adapt to new roles and expectations as they mature.</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>"Curiouser and curiouser" - This playful repetition emphasizes Alice's growing curiosity and wonder in the strange world.</p><p>"Mad Hatter's Tea Party" - The wordplay "mad" suggests not just craziness but also "unconventional," reflecting the party's nonsensical nature.</p><p>"Have some wine," the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all around the table, but there was nothing but tea. "I don't see any wine," she remarked. "There isn't any," said the March Hare. "Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it," Alice remarked in a huff. "It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited," said the March Hare. This playful exchange uses wordplay to highlight the nonsensical rules of the tea party.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>"Curiouser and curiouser" - Alice's phrase emphasizes her surprise and the illogical nature of Wonderland. It plays on the rules of grammar, adding to the story's whimsical tone.</p><p>The "Caucus-race" - A satirical reference to the political system, it mocks the meaningless and repetitive nature of politics.</p><p>"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?" - A nonsensical riddle posed by the Mad Hatter, illustrating the absurdity and lack of straightforward answers in Wonderland.</p><p>These instances contribute to the story's overall theme of exploring the boundaries of logic and language.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>Three instances of wordplay -</p><p>"We're all mad here" - The Cheshire Cat's statement plays on the double meaning of "mad" as both angry and insane.</p><p>The Mock Turtle's "school subjects" like Reeling and Writhing (Reading and Writing) and Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division).</p><p>The use of "tale" and "tail" in the Mouse's story, where the shape of the text forms a tail on the page.</p><p>These wordplays contribute to the whimsical and nonsensical nature of Wonderland, challenging Alice's (and the reader's) understanding of language and meaning.</p><p>Analyze the poem "Jabberwocky." What makes it nonsensical, and what literary devices does it employ?</p><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>"Jabberwocky" - This nonsensical poem uses invented words ("Jabberwock," "brillig") alongside real ones, creating a dreamlike and playful atmosphere. It employs literary devices like onomatopoeia ("beamish") and meter (trochaic tetrameter) to create a sense of rhythm despite the nonsensical words.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>"Jabberwocky" is a poem filled with nonsensical words and portmanteau, showcasing Carroll's inventive use of language. It uses literary devices like rhyme and meter, creating a sense of narrative despite the invented vocabulary. The nonsensical nature of the poem emphasizes the fluidity and playfulness of language, reinforcing Wonderland's themes of ambiguity and imagination.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>The poem "Jabberwocky" appears in the sequel, "Through the Looking-Glass," not in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." However, it's a prime example of Carroll's wordplay and nonsense poetry.</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>The concept of celebrating "un-birthdays" challenges conventional logic. It questions the purpose of celebrations and suggests that everyday life can be as joyful as a birthday.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>The "un-birthday" concept challenges conventional logic by subverting the idea of special occasions. By celebrating every day that isn't one's birthday, it introduces the absurdity of assigning significance arbitrarily, highlighting the story's playful take on logic.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>The concept of "un-birthday" challenges conventional logic by inverting the unique nature of birthdays. By celebrating the 364 days that are not one's birthday, it humorously questions why we only celebrate on one specific day. This concept plays with the arbitrary nature of social conventions and encourages thinking outside normal parameters.</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>Wonderland constantly challenges the relationship between language and reality. Words don't always have clear meanings, and characters often play with them for humor or confusion. This makes Alice question how we define reality and the meaning behind what we say.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>The story explores the tenuous relationship between language and reality. Characters often twist meanings and use language in unconventional ways, creating confusion and absurdity. This reflects the idea that words and meanings are subjective, and that reality is shaped by perception and interpretation.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>The story explores the relationship between language, meaning, and reality through its frequent wordplay and logical paradoxes. Characters often use words in unconventional ways or take figurative language literally, highlighting how language shapes our perception of reality. The absurd logic of Wonderland challenges the idea that language and reality have a fixed, one-to-one relationship.</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>The story satirizes aspects of Victorian society. The obsession with order and manners is exaggerated in the Queen of Hearts' character. The nonsensical rules and trials reflect the rigid social structures of the time.</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>The story reflects and critiques aspects of Victorian society, particularly its rigid social hierarchy, obsession with rules, and the often arbitrary nature of authority. Characters like the Queen of Hearts embody the irrationality of power, while scenes like the tea party mock social norms and etiquette.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" reflects and critiques various aspects of Victorian society. The rigid class structure is satirized through characters like the Queen of Hearts. The emphasis on proper behavior and manners is both represented and subverted throughout Alice's interactions. The story also pokes fun at the Victorian education system, with its focus on rote memorization (Alice's inability to correctly recite poems).</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>Lewis Carroll, a mathematician, embedded mathematical and logical puzzles in the story. The Caucus-Race, for example, mocks the logic of Victorian education.</p><pre></pre><p>Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a mathematician, and elements of logic puzzles and paradoxes are woven throughout the narrative. Examples include the illogical progression of events, the nonsensical rules in the Queen's court, and the wordplay that challenges conventional logic.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>Lewis Carroll, whose real name was Charles Dodgson, was a mathematician and logician. This background is evident in the mathematical and logical concepts hidden in the story. For example, the Mad Hatter's tea party plays with the concept of time, while Alice's changes in size relate to problems of scale and proportion. The Cheshire Cat's discussions about madness and logic challenge conventional reasoning.</p><pre></pre><blockquote><p>Gemini 1.5 Flash</p></blockquote><p>Disney's adaptation streamlines the narrative, focusing more on Alice's interactions with iconic characters like the Mad Hatter and Cheshire Cat. The trial is shortened, and</p><blockquote><p>GPT-4o</p></blockquote><p>The Disney adaptation makes several changes for a more family-friendly narrative. Plot elements are simplified, and certain characters are given more whimsical traits. For example, the Queen of Hearts is portrayed as more comedic than tyrannical. Themes are softened, focusing more on the whimsical and fantastical elements, while the darker undertones and critiques of society in the original are downplayed.</p><blockquote><p>Claude-3.5 Sonnet</p></blockquote><p>Comparing the original story to Disney's animated adaptation would reveal significant differences. The Disney version simplifies the plot, removes some of the darker elements, and adds musical numbers. Characters like the Cheshire Cat are given more prominence, while others are omitted. The themes in the Disney version focus more on the whimsical aspects and less on the social commentary present in Carroll's original work. However, a detailed comparison would require a close analysis of both works, which is beyond the scope of this response.</p></div>
