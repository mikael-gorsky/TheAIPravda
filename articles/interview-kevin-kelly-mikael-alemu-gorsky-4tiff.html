  <div><h2>1. Introduction: The Difficulty of Predicting the Future (Focus on VR/AI)</h2><blockquote><p>Kevin Kelly reflects on the challenge of accurate prediction, citing his early excitement for VR in 1987. He notes that while VR technology hasn't fundamentally changed drastically, its cost has plummeted. He expresses surprise at VR's slow adoption over decades, contrasting it with AI's recent "50-year overnight success." He suggests VR might still be awaiting its own transformative "LLM moment."</p></blockquote><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> What I've learned with the future is that it's easy to make predictions and hard to make predictions that are true. Jaron Lanier showed me VR in '87. I was completely blown away and I thought, "Oh my gosh, this is the future." The VR that we had back then is not that much different than the VR you get now. The difference was that was multi-million dollars and it is now a hundred dollars. I've been very, very surprised about how slow that has been. You could say VR is still waiting for its LLM moment. AI's 50-year overnight success.</p><h2>2. The Influence of Annie Dillard</h2><blockquote><p>Kevin and Dan share a deep appreciation for writer Annie Dillard. Kevin describes her unique style blending poetic prose, cosmic wonder, and grounded scientific detail. He highlights her ability to find transcendence in the ordinary and confront both beauty and horror. Her book <em>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</em>, discovered serendipitously by Kevin in Sri Lanka, was a primary inspiration for him to become a writer. He also shares a personal anecdote of correspondence with her.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I am very excited to have you. In addition to being a personal hero of mine, I am a long-time Wired reader. I had a gigantic shelf of magazines growing up. It's crazy to get to chat with you. There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about. I want to start with, we have a mutual love of Annie Dillard.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> We do. She's my favorite writer and I know she's your favorite writer as well.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Tell me why you like her.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> For those who aren't familiar with Annie, she burst onto the scene with a meteorite of a book called Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. It's an account of her spending a year musing, like a Henry David Thoreau intimate investigation of a creek in Virginia or West Virginia, I don't remember. It was the writing and the style and the ideas and her blazing brilliance in being able to capture this into a few words. It was almost poetry, though it was prose. It somehow worked on my brain. I don't know enough about literature to describe her in relation to other writers and why it doesn't work for me as much, but there was something about her spirit as well as her writing, which was very expansive, cosmic, enthusiastic, questioning. She talked about feeling as if at one point in the story that she was a bell that someone else had run. And I felt exactly the same in response to her writing. It was like she was ringing my bell in a curious way.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Lifted and struck. There's another part in the early part of the book where she talks about the tree with the lights in it. And that moment is so very evocative of one of her big themes, which is you can be walking around in ordinary life and ordinary nature and somehow the veil is lifted from your eyes and you can experience these moments of transcendence where everything feels like it's glowing from within.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes. So, there was this, her cosmic poet ability to take these moments, but then interstitial with that were these findings, these weird little trivia bits that you'd find in some obscure book that you would be grounded in before the next jump. It was a very distinctive way of wrapping episodic ecstasy with very concrete science trivia or oddities. And that combination somehow appealed to me.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> The thing I remember is she spends a long time talking about Henle's loops, which are this little part of the kidney. And it's like, where does that even come from? And I think she zooms out to the biggest stuff and then zooms into the smallest stuff. But another thing that's interesting about her writing, and I'm curious how you've thought about this in your own work, is she spends a lot of time talking about the beauty of the world, but she also spends a lot of time talking about the worst of the world. There's an entire chapter on insects and how gross insects are. She's also angry about it and not afraid to be angry about it. And I think a lot of writers are usually either one or the other. Either you're angry or you're, everything's beautiful and awesome. And she does both pretty well.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That's true. I think either she said in the book or elsewhere that she wrote the book as if there was a patient of cancer dying in her room, and she's talking to them. So yes, it's not saccharine. It's not sweet kumbaya. She can be pretty harsh too. And that is part of the attraction of the sweet sour flavor.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> How has she, if at all, influenced how you write or edit?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> In some ways it's why I write at all, because I came across that book in the weirdest of all places. It was in a library, an American library in Kandy, Sri Lanka. And I walked in because there was air conditioning. And there was a book—why they had the book there, I don't know. But there was a book, it opened up and from the first immediate paragraph, "I once had a Tomcat..." I was caught and I didn't put it down. And it was like, I don't know what she's doing, but I want to do that. If I could do that, I'm it, I'm golden.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I feel the same way. Have you read any of her other stuff?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes. I didn't read her fiction book, but the other books of essay, Teaching a Stone to Talk and—</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Holy the Firm, The Writing Life.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes, Holy the Firm and all those, yes. And her account of the eclipse, the total eclipse, it's never to be equaled. Anybody who writes about eclipse has to start with Annie's version.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> It's funny because the reason I started with Annie is I love her so much. And she evokes all the same feelings in me that I think she evokes for you and gives me that same energy to write. If I write after I've read something that she's written, it brings something out in me that I love. And also, no one else I know likes her or even has heard about her. I feel like a lot of her work is maybe taught in school, but it's the thing that you're assigned, but people don't like as much.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Well, they probably also don't read the whole thing. They probably would have understood if they only got the excerpt. It's probably some wind passage about the lights in the trees or whatever. It is true. Because she didn't, I mean, she wrote a couple other books, but she didn't go on to have a huge amount of work and a huge amount of output for whatever reason. I sent her a book that I did when I was riding my bicycle across the country. I did a haiku and a sketch every day. And I sent her the book, the original. And because I thought I was inspired by her, I thought that she would enjoy it. And she sent some nice words in response to the book and sent it back. So that was my one time when I wrote to a hero.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> That's nice. I bet a reply from Annie is probably pretty rare. So that's pretty great.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I think I still have it. I think it's right behind me. I should dig it up and see. She did, there was one little drawing. She said she liked that little drawing. So that was good.</p><h2>3. Navigating the Frontier: Pioneer vs. Builder Mentality</h2><blockquote><p>The conversation explores the natural transition in technology from unstructured "pioneer" phases to organized "builder" phases, using Burning Man's evolution from chaos to structured city as an analogy. While acknowledging the loss of freedom, Kevin argues that structure enables greater possibilities. He emphasizes the importance of continuously creating new frontiers while developing established areas. He personally navigates this by "visiting" the frontier (early tech, remote travel) but grounding himself in history and long-term thinking (Long Now).</p></blockquote><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Another thing to move on from Annie for a second. One thing that you wrote in your book, The Inevitable, that I loved and thought was interesting is "after living online for the past three decades, first as pioneer in a rather wild, empty quarter, and then later as a builder who constructed parts of this new continent. My confidence in this inevitability is based on the depth of these technological changes." I love the pioneer to builder transition. I've been watching this show, an old HBO show called Deadwood... it's about Deadwood... a mining town... it had no law. And the whole show is about that transition from pioneer to order out of chaos. And I think there's a lot of resonance with what you wrote and this transition from pioneer to builder feels like something that's deeply embedded into tech, even with every single wave. In this new AI wave, there's this whole movement of pioneers figuring out the new landscape, and then the builders move in. Tell me about what that's been like for you to participate in and watch over the last couple of decades.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes. There are always feelings of loss as the freedom of no laws, the unvarnished, the unconstrained ability to do what you want without having to ask permission that goes away. I had another experience like that, which was Burning Man. I was reminded of it because I did a podcast with Burning Man today. And they were reminiscing about my first time at Burning Man, '96 or so, when there were no streets, there was no adult supervision at all, there was no sense of order. It was crazy and chaotic and wonderful, but the second year, I think somebody died because they got run over by a car... And so it was like, "Oh, we need streets." Okay. And over years and years of Burning Man, they have more and more of the layering of law and order. They have tons and tons of police and sheriffs and whatnot and laws and the bureaucratic stuff... The artwork I did last year was unbelievable... But at the same time, I think Burning Man is better than ever. So you lose something, but I think there's more to be gained by adding that layer of organization and structure and governance. What you want to have though, is you still want to have those zones where there's a frontier. You want to keep making new territory that generates new frontiers. And some people are better on the frontier than back at the center... So for me, I want to maintain both: constantly new frontiers, where those suited to not having many rules are able to thrive, and then those who prefer the discipline of working within rules also can thrive.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> What about in your own life? Because as someone interested in new technology, that requires being on the frontier... being a restless spirit can be hard, it can be lonely. How have you balanced that or dealt with that in your own life?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I tend to visit the frontier. I spent a lot of my adult life in the very remote parts of Asia, where there was very little infrastructure... I thoroughly enjoyed it, but I would have died if I needed to live there... It was a great place to visit, but it was only great because I was going to leave. My feeling about the frontiers is like, Burning Man is fantastic for two weeks, but it would be horrible to live there year round. And being at the frontier of the internet or AI, my understanding is that it's a moving frontier. It's going to move. I can keep going up to the edge to see what's happening, but I don't need to stay there. I'm going to come back and report anyway. So I have the liberty of being a nomad in that sense, of occupying it. For me, it's a fantastic place to spend time in, but not a place I want to spend all my time in.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> And how does that work? Because I understand the frontier of going to another country and being able to come home. But with technology, you can be at the frontier in your house. Is that structured for you? Are there periods in your life or periods in your day where you're immersing yourself in what's new and then periods where you're in the stability of whatever you're familiar with? How does it work?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes. One of the things I discovered over time is that all my favorite people who were best about the future were also great historians. So I would balance reading something about AI with trying to read something historical from the past, and balance wrestling with the latest AI with working in my workshop and using my hands. So for me, yes, that's exactly what it is. Jeff Bezos said he was trying to build a business on the things that didn't change. The Long Now Foundation, which I've been very central to, is trying to take a long term view, not just forward, but also the past. So for me, I would spend time on this ephemeral frontier, but also then try to think about the next 10,000 years or the last 10,000 years.</p><h2>4. Defining Intelligence: The Electricity Analogy and Cognitive Compounds</h2><blockquote><p>Kevin proposes our current understanding of intelligence is as primitive as early knowledge of electricity, citing Newton's errors. He hypothesizes intelligence isn't a single entity but a "compound" of various cognitive elements yet to be identified, similar to how salt is a compound. He views human intelligence as just one specific "edge case" mixture and believes AI will explore a vast "possibility space" of diverse thinking types, some unrecognizable to us now. He references Minsky and "mixture of experts" as supporting this compound view.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Dan:</strong> As you're digging into the current AI wave, what are the historical periods that you're thinking about or diving into?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I spent a good amount of time recently reading about the discovery or invention of electricity. Because my contention right now is we have no idea what intelligence is. We're as ignorant of it as Isaac Newton and others were of electricity when it was first encountered. And Isaac Newton, one of the smartest humans ever, was totally wrong about electricity. He had wrong, weird ideas about it. They were just wrong.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> What did he think about it? I have not heard anything about Isaac Newton and electricity. That's interesting.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> He was one of the people who thought there was this phlogiston... It was this element. There was another element. The discovery of electricity was happening at the same time that we were understanding what elements and atoms and compounds were. So Davies and Faraday and those guys were discovering stuff about electricity almost weekly. The origins of the Royal Academy came out of the weekly meetings they would have where they would sell tickets and do demos with electricity and make sparks. One of the biggest news items was when they... proved that electricity would happen in a vacuum because there goes the ether... "Well, then what is it?" Okay. And some of the earliest beliefs about electricity was that it was primarily a biological phenomenon, with all those reflexes. So there were endless theories about what it is. And they all reminded me of all the theories we have about what intelligence is, because we don't know what it is. I have been saying, I suspect that intelligence is not an element, but a compound. That it is made up of a complex of different cognitive elements. And we haven't even identified them yet, in the same way that salt is not an element. Salt is a compound of some elements they had not yet identified. You can think of the current AI as making some kind of salt and we don't even know what it's made from.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I think that's true. Where it makes my mind go, and I'm curious how you would respond to this, is we do know what it is, but we don't know it in the same way that we know what electricity is. We don't have an explicit, exact mathematical theory... And we don't have a way to decompose it into parts that reduce down and then recombine into it. But we do know what it is in a different way. I'm talking to you and I know that you're intelligent. That's harder to grasp... But I think that may be a property of intelligence that it is this fuzzy thing. How do you think about that?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I don't know. You may be confusing recognizing something with knowing it. I think we can recognize it, but I don't think we know what it is. In fact, I think our brains are incredibly opaque to introspection, deliberately. I think we have these complex things that deliberately do not allow the organism to interfere and meddle with it. Could you imagine if we had access to the source code? We'd be completely wrecking ourselves. What it is, again, I think we humans have a very peculiar complex of things that if we map it out in the possibility space of all possible minds... our compound is way at the edge. We're an edge species... Our kind of intelligence will be revealed to be a very peculiar mixture that's evolved for us. Then what we're going to be doing with AIs is making hundreds of various other kinds and filling out that possibility space with many types of thinking. We'll look back and we won't even recognize maybe some of these other things as intelligence right now, because we don't have a very good definition... Some people say, well, there isn't anything. There's only universal intelligence... That there's only one thing. That's possible, but I suspect that's wrong. I suspect there are many compounds and that they will be engineered to do different things. And to some degree, we won't understand how they work, because they're different. So I think we are very much like the early days of electricity where we simply didn't have a clue about what it was, even though we could use it, even though we could recognize it.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Where does your intuition that it's made up of compounds come from?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Several reasons. One is, Marvin Minsky was the first who suggested it, called the Society of Mind. Then these days, the AIs have mixture of experts, where they are already doing that, taking different kinds of cognition and making them into compounds. I think we'll have various layers of this, like tissues... made up from lots of little bits of elemental cognition. What we haven't done yet is the chemistry of identifying what some of the basic cognitive units are, the cognitive elements. We may be starting to do that.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Thinking about the way neural networks work, a way to look at them is they learn many thousands or millions of rules for what to do in particular situations that they can partially apply and run many of those rules in parallel to find the right set that applies to a particular situation. In that case, intelligence is a compound of rules... But it's interesting to think about how much of those rules are contingent... versus universal. Because we do know, for example, how neural networks function at a low level... we know the atomic units. And the specific architecture, the specific set of atomic units you use doesn't matter much for the high level behavior... you can get basically the same behavior no matter the simple components you use. So there's something always hard to understand in between the simple components and the outward behavior we observe.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Danny Hillis made a computer with tinker toys. You can make computers out of all kinds of elements... So I don't want to confuse the neural nets. I don't think that is the basic unit. I think there is a type of reasoning or learning or something that happens with the neural nets that we haven't quite identified yet that I would say would be the element—what is that process of pattern matching, or deduction, or logic, or what's the workflow for doing deduction. And it could be agnostic to the actual platform. It seems it must be in some way. But yes, that's interesting.</p><h2>5. Career Philosophy: Aiming to Be the Only</h2><blockquote><p>Kevin shares his key career advice: "Don't aim to be the best, aim to be the only." This principle crystallized during his time at Wired when he realized certain story ideas were uniquely his to execute. It emphasizes finding and focusing on one's unique contribution. He relates this to successfully assigning stories to writers like young Neal Stephenson by aligning assignments with their inherent interests, suggesting this as a way to overcome the common challenge of getting others to write one's ideas.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Dan:</strong> One of the things I love about the way you've set up your career... is it's about being honest and authentic to who you are instead of what you think you should be doing. I found that over and over again... especially at the beginning of a career, it's easy to be like, "I need to do things in this particular way." And then at some point, you're like... "This isn't working as well as it should. This sucks. I guess I have to do the thing that's more honest to who I am..." Hearing you talk about that in various forums over the years has been quite helpful for me. How does that look now after many years of thinking that way? Is that still something on your mind that's difficult that you have to unstick yourself from? Or do you get used to living that way after a while?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> My own life was never very planned or deliberate in that sense. I had more directions than destinies or destinations. A phrase that I like or advice I like to give these days is: don't aim to be the best, aim to be the only. Be the only. But that was not something I was doing consciously when I was younger. That was something I only realized I was doing much later... I did wish someone had told me that earlier. So I think I did a bunch of things very intuitively without necessarily having a grand plan about it... This idea of being the only was made clear to me first at Wired. I was trying to assign stories I had to other writers and often not getting any traction with a great idea I couldn't sell to anybody. After years of trying to kill it, I would wind up doing it myself and then realizing, "Oh, that's because only I can do it." And that's what I should be focusing on to begin with... So the clarity of it, I think I have more clarity of it, but I'm still doing what I've always done, perhaps being a little more aware of the actual process of doing it.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I resonate very much with trying to get writers to do an idea. The company I run, it's a media company... I come from the software world. If you have a product idea, and you build a little bit of it, you can have someone else build most of the product... But getting a writer to write your idea, it's never any good. Almost never. The people who are good ghostwriters are such a small portion of writers.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That wasn't my experience. My experience was that the writers were even better. I discovered reading IEEE Spectrum that they were laying the fiber optic cables around the globe... I thought, "They're wiring up the noosphere. That'd be a great story." So I assigned Neil Stephenson to that. He did this masterpiece I could never have done. And Bruce Sterling and the other great writers. They did a much better job of writing it than I ever could.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Well, I wish I had Neal Stephenson writing for me.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Here's the thing. This is what I tell every aspiring writer: get the young science fiction writers of today and give them journalistic assignments. They love it. Because they're born storytellers, you're paying them to go learn something they want to learn. And they'll come back with something amazing.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I think that's the key thing. What I'm more talking about... I've worked with a lot of talented writers... But trying to get someone to write about something they don't want to write about, it's never going to be that good, in my experience.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Well, yes, you have to match it to something they're interested in. That's the trick. I wasn't giving them, I wasn't making them write something they weren't interested in... Sometimes that's how the conversation would start, "Okay, what's something you're interested in, that we can help make happen, that we can pay you to educate yourself in." And we could jointly come up with an idea... If I was running a magazine, that's the first thing I would start doing: finding the youngest science fiction writers and giving them assignments.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I should look into that. Mostly, I find people who write good tweets that I find interesting.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That's fine. That's a good way to start. But find someone who can tell a good story and has a little ability to fantasize or whatever... And Neal was not Neal when we were first starting; he was still at the beginning of his career, which is, of course, why he agreed to it.</p><p><strong>6. AI as a Creative Partner: Research, Editing, and the Audience of One</strong></p><blockquote><p>As a "reluctant writer," Kevin finds AI invaluable for overcoming the blank page, organizing thoughts, and research. He stresses that using AI effectively is a skill requiring practice. He illustrates the concept of "Audience of One" creation with his personal AI project: simulating a historical figures' meeting (da Vinci, Luther, Columbus) that spiraled into world-building, novel generation, and marketing materials, all done purely for the joy of the creative process itself, not for sharing. He posits much AI generation serves this personal fulfillment. </p></blockquote><p><strong>Dan:</strong> One of the things you talk about a lot is being a reluctant writer and born editor. Getting into AI for a second, one of the things that strikes me about AI is it puts you into editing mode much quicker.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes, it does.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> How has that worked for you?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> It's been great because I can get over that big hump, helping get something on the page and starting to work with and illuminating the spots that I'm most ignorant of. For me, it's a great way to start.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Is there anything that has worked particularly well, as part of your workflow to get it started?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I use it for research. I use some of them for research, too. That's another way. While you're researching, you're summarizing and synthesizing... The LLMs are good at organizing things. That's another thing. I'm not that organized... I'm a gardener rather than architect in terms of things. So I can get a little further along thinking about it in an architectural way. For me, it's a great way to start on things.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> What are you using day to day?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I'm using mostly OpenAI right now... I have the Pro version... I've done some very deep research and it's astounding. I'm reminded again and again that this is a skill. Using it, getting the most from it, is a skill that will take your 10,000 hours. It's definitely not just pushing buttons... It's apparent to me I need to spend a lot more time whispering and understanding how to use it. My needs right this moment are not such that I'm using that level of research every day.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Do you have specific examples of when you've used it for research that it has blown you away?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I did something, this is something I've been meaning to write about: I had this fantasy, this observation, that I realized Leonardo da Vinci, Martin Luther and Christopher Columbus were all alive at the same time. I said, this is my conversation with the AI, I said, "Imagine it's a snowy evening and all three are stuck in the same hotel together and they have a conversation... based on their interests and their personalities." So it did the conversation. I said, "That was amazing. But they got along so well, they decided to collaborate on a project. What would that project be?" And this was the AI's idea. The AI's idea was that they would want to start a new city in the new world based around science and religious freedom. I said, "Okay, start writing Wikipedia articles about this city and we'll start filling it in." Then we had characters and peoples and histories. Then I was going on, starting to tell research stories based on these characters. Then I introduced other things, like other contemporaries, like Queen Victoria... she was the main rival... They reached China 10 years before the Portuguese... brought all the books from China. So I was making this bigger and bigger thing, world building. I got 10 different novels from it. Then I had it synthesize and iron out all the contradictions... and make a big epic saga. Then I had it write the book covers and the marketing materials. The point of all this is that I'm not going to show it to anybody because I don't need to; the joy of creating it was better than reading it. It was the audience of one. So what I'm hypothesizing is that a lot of the generative stuff, the 50 million images generated each day with AI, 99.999% have the audience of one. They're generated for the pleasure of the co-creator. This idea of people making feature length movies for themselves. The pleasure will be in the generating of the movie, the co-generating of the movie that you're directing... Anyway, that was a project using it because the degree of historical realism and fantasy was mind bending.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> That's cool. I love that. It seems like there's an interesting line from "a thousand true fans" to "an audience of one." How have you thought about that?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Of course, there's no economic model for the audience of one. There is for OpenAI... I think this is the abundance mindset where you have the time to do this. This is not so much a business or someone's career. I think this is a different form of entertainment or self-expression. It's like Sunday painting or keeping a journal or someone doing ice skating. It's a form of self-expression and relaxation and enjoyment, entertainment. It's closer to entertainment than it is to a career.</p><h2>7. The Future of AI Interaction: Emotion, Companionship, and Memory</h2><blockquote><p>The discussion touches on the potential for deep human-AI relationships. Kevin predicts highly effective AI therapists and companions, anticipating surprising levels of emotional bonding as emotions are integrated into AI. He sees new features like OpenAI's persistent memory—allowing AI to "know" users over time—as crucial steps toward this deeper connection and dependence, despite inherent trade-offs.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Dan:</strong> It reminds me a little bit of, are you familiar with active imagination?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> It's part of Jungian psychotherapy. The idea being you can do active imagination where you take a dream... re-enter the dream world while you're waking and explore some of the archetypes and themes... In doing that it reflects back to you things that might be more latent in your psyche. The fact that you're playing around with these characters and these novels are going in different directions, and the decisions you're making might say something to you about what you're processing... that in addition to being fun, it might tell you something about yourself.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes. It may be something like that. In fact... I think there will be very, very good AI therapists... Maybe some particular AI companions, AI buddies, AI partners will perform some of that and people will use them in that capacity... This is something else I've been saying: I think people are going to be shocked by the degree of emotion, emotional bonding that we will have as we put emotions into the AIs. Some people will be very close to these on an always-on basis and very dependent on them to do their best.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> One thing, I don't know if you saw, but just came out today, a couple hours ago.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> No, I haven't seen it; I've been podcasting.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> You're in for a treat... OpenAI released a new memory system for ChatGPT. Previously ChatGPT, you could ask it to save memories, but it would do it when explicitly told to... But the new memory system is able to access the past history of all your relevant chats automatically. So you can ask things like, "What do you know about me from all of our chats that I might not know about myself?" It will go through all these historical chats and tell you interesting things. I've been playing around... I think you'll like it. And to that emotional attachment point, I want to use something that feels like it knows me. I get more attached to it. I personally think that's good. But there are tradeoffs, obviously. I'll be curious to see how that changes how we relate to each other over the next couple years.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Yes. That's cool.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I've noticed you're also doing a lot of tweeting with what looks like AI generated images. Are you using native image generation for that?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I think they're mostly Midjourney... Which for me, I have a habit of that. It's comfortable. I know DALL-E... the chat now has some which I've tried and it's pretty good. But I like the public aspect of the Midjourney Discord, where it was a huge quick learning curve, because you see the prompts other people were doing, and how you could get there. I like that public aspect of it.</p><h2>8. Reflections on Technological Adoption and Prediction Failures (VR, eBay, Blockchain)</h2><blockquote><p>Kevin analyzes past prediction errors to illustrate the difficulty of forecasting. He underestimated VR's biological/physical hurdles (slowing adoption) and expects robotics to be similarly slow. He misjudged eBay, initially dismissing the auction model but now seeing its success in the broader marketplace. For blockchain/Bitcoin, he wrongly expected micropayments and non-financial uses, missing the store-of-value emergence and dominance of finance due to costs and incentives. He concludes prediction is easy, but accuracy is hard.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I'm curious if we zoom back out, you've seen a lot of different technology waves. One of the interesting things about this particular one is how scared people are... probably true to some extent of previous ones. But in many ways, with mobile, people didn't even care... At least in my lifetime. I'm curious what you've learned from seeing all these different waves come and go, what you've learned about the future, and how to think about the future?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> That's a pretty big question. The first thing I think about are all the places I was wrong.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Where were you wrong?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So many times. I was very wrong about VR. Jaron Lanier showed me VR in '87... I was completely blown away. And I thought, "Oh my gosh, this is the future..." To be clear, the VR we had back then... many decades ago, is not that much different than the VR you get now. The difference was that that was multi-million dollars, and it is now $100... It is better, but it's not a million times better, but it's a million times cheaper. So I have been very surprised about how resistant, how slow that has been, because I expected that to take off. I was wrong about eBay... I thought, "I don't get it... who would use this?" I didn't have the imagination to see it. I was early to blockchain, but I didn't think Bitcoin was going to be much. I didn't understand. I didn't foresee the way in which it became this store of value. I expected, like everyone else, that it could be used for micro payments. But... I didn't understand or appreciate... how expensive it was going to be to do the processing. So my expectations about the role of blockchain—I also thought we would have more headway into things that were not financial... Blockchain became completely overwhelmed by the amount of money in it. It became about money and finance. I thought it would be used for things that had nothing to do with finance, and that didn't happen. So that's when I think about what I've learned with the future: it's easy to make predictions and hard to make predictions that are true.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> If we go back to those specific cases, it seems like there is one case where you're like, "This definitely has a future," and two other cases where you're like, "I don't think these are that great..." Let's talk about the first one. You're like, "This definitely has a future." What do you draw from that? What do you think you missed there that made it much harder than you expected to get people to adopt it?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I think it required a lot of biology and understanding or being able to work with biological things. Rather than our mind, you have focusing on your eyes, you have the weight of the thing on your head. There are many biological things. In addition to the hardware things, you have hardware biology and that is going to go slower. One of the things I take from that is I think the arrival of robots is going to take much, much longer than people think because we have a 25-watt supercomputer and a quarter horsepower engine. There's no way we can do all that kind of stuff with that kind of efficiency anywhere close to that... The amount of power we need... is a huge, huge gap. So that physicality of it, particularly around our bodies, the scale of our bodies, I think is going to be a lot slower. That's what I've taken away from what I've learned about VR: it's going to take a lot more time than making AI.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> That's interesting because I was going to bring up AI as an interesting parallel example where it also took a lot longer to do AI than we thought it would, but then it seemed to suddenly happen in about 10 years. I'm curious what you think the leading indicators are for something like that. AI didn't work for 50 years and then suddenly in 2010 or so, there were some glimmers of hope... And VR, if we wanted to measure where we are in that cycle, do you have a thought for that?</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> You could say VR is still waiting for its LLM moment, right, where there's some technical breakthrough in the lenses or focusing or projection that allows for that. It's interesting too that the LLMs weren't working on reasoning directly. They were doing language translation and they noticed there was some reasoning happening in language translation, which was completely unexpected. Maybe the key technology for VR/AR will come from somewhere else, but it hasn't happened yet. It doesn't look like it's happening right now. So yes, AI is a 50-year overnight success.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> What about going back to the other two examples, eBay and blockchain, of "Hey, this isn't really that interesting."</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Right. So eBay, I think with the auction aspect, the only reason why eBay worked is that people move beyond the auction. I use eBay all the time and I've never used an auction. I have no patience for it. So I think the idea that it was auctions—that I didn't connect to and I was never interested in. I could be wrong, but for me, eBay has only now succeeded because most people aren't using the auctions. But I don't know if that's true or not.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> Do you use auctions on eBay? I got into eBay when I was about 10 and I was like, "I want to sell everything in my dad's garage."</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Did you?</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I didn't end up doing it because selling things online as a 10-year-old was a complicated situation. But I was into it for that reason. But I've never bought anything on eBay. I've never bid.</p><p><strong>Kevin:</strong> eBay is very useful. It's like there's Amazon and then there's Alibaba and then there's eBay, which is for all the things that either aren't officially for sale or they're way out of stock or out of print or they're totally obscure. So for me, if I can't find it on Amazon, Alibaba, then you're onto eBay. Etsy is another level, which is handmade stuff. But eBay is good for obscure stuff. They do have the option of auctioning, but I never use it. Anyway, for me, the thing was this idea of auctioning for everything didn't seem like it was going to work. But for a while it did. That was just me personally, not being much of a bargainer type.</p><p><strong>Dan:</strong> I guess you can't win them all.</p></div>
