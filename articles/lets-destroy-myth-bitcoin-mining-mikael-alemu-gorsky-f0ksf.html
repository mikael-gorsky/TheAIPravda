  <div><h2>Premise of bitcoin mining in Ethiopia</h2><p></p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4D12AQEIGTRxHPz3jQ" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQEIGTRxHPz3jQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1733002331169?e=1753920000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=GkW3Ba5f0-waYmzyltxvaHfPoweMvau1PzM7eXbieds"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I have been reading numerous messages and posts claiming that Ethiopia will somehow benefit from Bitcoin mining. However, I haven't seen a clear and logical explanation in any of these posts. Therefore, I will attempt to reconstruct this concept and provide my perspective, which is diametrically opposed to this optimistic view.</p><p>The idea goes as follows: Ethiopia has an abundant supply of very cheap electricity. This electricity should be converted into cryptocurrency, which can then be sold. It's a simple notion—we have something in abundance that we do not fully utilize, so we should use it in a way that will make us rich. The assumption here is that electricity is like sunlight, water in a river, bananas from a tree, or leaves—readily available and easy to convert into something of value that we can sell.</p><p>However, these positions are largely untrue.</p><h2>Technical barriers and security risks</h2><p></p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4D12AQH_s9S-bDQIeA" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQH_s9S-bDQIeA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1733002347361?e=1753920000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=0ZEsBTjtOLoBynrpFtVcGoFEIH69C9zsh5y15udMa5U"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Generating cryptocurrency is a relatively straightforward process in terms of knowing how to do it. You invest tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to purchase servers, connect them to the cryptocurrency network—such as Bitcoin—and you start mining. But first, this is very expensive; the demand for these servers is enormous. Additionally, policies regulate the use of these servers because mining Bitcoin essentially involves encoding and decoding messages and performing mathematical operations related to cryptography. This is precisely what every terrorist group needs to prevent government forces from reading their communications. It's easy to understand why every security force in the world is concerned about the flow of such servers and will likely license every purchase or import, probably taking note of users and usage scenarios.</p><p>Moreover, when we talk about mining Bitcoin, we must understand that this happens online. You not only need servers; you need servers connected to fast, uninterrupted internet, and the connections to these servers must not be blocked by countries, providers, or firewalls. These are the conditions required for Bitcoin mining.</p><h2>Reality of Ethiopia's power infrastructure</h2><p></p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4D12AQFP3aSnh0ekkQ" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFP3aSnh0ekkQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1733002361880?e=1753920000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=80FDHcj3JQJ9Q4g6u4aN1wFeWrL55hHOB4BidlOrQlM"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Now, let's talk about electricity. First of all, Ethiopia does not have any surplus electricity. If we look at statistics on the amount of oil imported into the country and the data on how much oil is used for electricity generation, we'll see that Ethiopia generates more electricity from imported oil than from its 13 hydroelectric stations. This clearly indicates a deficit and a significant need for electricity.</p><p>Our electricity is generated by 13 hydroelectric stations. These stations are very old and not functioning at full capacity. They have problematic equipment that requires substantial funds to repair. Electricity generated in remote areas needs to be delivered to where it's consumed. For this, you need transmission lines and high-voltage transformers in abundance. These lines are not working well, and those transformers are not plentiful. There is an enormous shortage of electricity delivered to people's homes. We experience blackouts even in central areas and in other locations.</p><p>If and when the transmission lines could be fixed and transformers built, we would have the benefit of people being able to light their homes every day of the week or have a refrigerator that actually works reliably. That's what Ethiopia needs electricity for. Ethiopia needs electricity to keep medicines refrigerated in every doctor's office and clinic across the country. And Ethiopia does not have that electricity. It does not generate enough electricity, does not transmit enough electricity, and does not deliver enough electricity. That is the situation with electricity.</p><h2>Economic and practical limitations</h2><p></p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4D12AQFPKlhSj4wYbQ" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFPKlhSj4wYbQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1733002375075?e=1753920000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=J4RvsV98EGlL8iTbmcTmczL8J32nmeIRMnkI2cGWRYo"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Therefore, none of these things are simple, and many are impossible. It's a dream—a dangerous dream because it distracts us from real needs. When thinking about dangerous dreams, we should also understand that any dreams about extra-expensive Bitcoins could be the death of any even distant dream of converting electricity to Bitcoins. The more expensive Bitcoin is, the higher the competition among Bitcoin miners. More competition means less availability of servers and more servers needed to be productive in Bitcoin mining. This business will become more expensive and less profitable.</p><p>Furthermore, Bitcoin doesn't only go up in value; it also goes down. The equipment and capital investment made for the purpose of Bitcoin mining might become obsolete. The wonderful economic dream painted by people promoting this notion of Ethiopian Bitcoin mining hinges mostly on the thesis that Ethiopia has the cheapest electricity in the world. And yes, we can find very outdated articles saying this. Is it true? Perhaps, for a very brief moment, maybe for a few months.</p><p>In the contract with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) that provides Ethiopia with $20 billion—so crucial for economic development—it stipulates that electricity should be priced at 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. Ten cents per kilowatt-hour is not the cheapest electricity in the world; it's cheap, but Ethiopia is a developing country with a population that doesn't have much money. So, yes, you should not make electricity exorbitantly expensive, but it's not that cheap.</p><p>If I were an investor considering building a mining farm in Ethiopia, I would look at several factors. First, whether the price of electricity is stable and suitable for my business plan. I wouldn't see any substantial preference here. Second, whether the country's export, import, licensing, and documentation regime is favorable for me to flexibly bring equipment in and out of the country and keep it securely within the country. I don't think so. Third, internet connection—will I have a constant and unthreatened internet connection, and will my servers and the ports I use for communicating with the Bitcoin mining network not be blocked? I wouldn't be able to build a strong case here either. Fourth, climate—do we have an optimal climate? No, Ethiopia is not a cold country, so cooling servers would be challenging.</p><h2>Future outlook and ethical concerns</h2><p>Therefore, if I were ever—and I wouldn't, for ethical and moral reasons—to consider investing in Bitcoin mining in Ethiopia, I would find it unviable. Moral reasons are also significant, as people have strong religious beliefs in Ethiopia, and cryptocurrencies are used mostly for crime or greed—approximately half for crime and half for greed.</p><p>So, what would be the best scenario? The best would be a nuclear power station with dedicated and unrestricted internet access and a favorable regime for importing and exporting goods. But such a regime is not in place. It's easy to see how Bitcoin mining might not be a good business strategy. This business does not have a long future, as more and more protocols in the cryptocurrency community are moving away from mining schemes where you convert electricity into cryptocurrency. They are moving to proof-of-stake protocols that do not give an edge to those who just use servers and electricity.</p><p>The second-largest blockchain—Ethereum—moved to proof-of-stake a few years ago, putting an end to the business of many miners. I really doubt that any new blockchains will adopt proof-of-work, as proof-of-stake is now a proven concept. There are even discussions about Bitcoin moving to proof-of-stake, which would completely kill the mining business.</p><p>Therefore, I don't think Bitcoin mining will do any good for the country. I believe it's detrimental to our economic future, as electricity can have so many better uses. I'm certain that it creates security risks and is morally problematic.</p><p>In conclusion, the notion that Ethiopia can benefit from Bitcoin mining is flawed. The country lacks surplus electricity, the necessary infrastructure, stable internet connections, and favorable regulatory conditions. Moreover, the global trend in cryptocurrency is moving away from mining-based protocols. Ethiopia should focus on using its electricity to meet essential needs, such as providing reliable power to homes and healthcare facilities, rather than chasing dangerous dreams that distract from real progress.</p></div>
