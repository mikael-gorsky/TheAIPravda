  <div><p>Hadas Lorber and Yaron Shilat ’s insightful opinion piece, “We need to unlock Israel's AI potential” (“Jerusalem Post”, 30/12/24) underscores the immense potential of AI to transform our economy and society. They highlight the prospect of AI adding $11.4 billion to Israel's economy in 2023 — a significant result that demands urgent attention from Israeli policymakers and innovators. By analyzing key challenges and proposing actionable steps, the publication serves as a rallying call to leverage AI for advancing Israeli growth. Building on their foundation, I aim to explore how we can focus AI initiatives to maximize their impact on everyday life for Israeli citizens, especially in ways that directly improve people's lives.</p><h2>Why we need to act now</h2><p>Lorber and Shilat highlight that Israel is a world leader in AI skills, yet only 9.1% of Israeli companies use advanced AI. This gap between our capabilities and actual use of AI needs urgent attention. Meanwhile, the Israeli government allocates most of its budget to three main areas: education, healthcare, and city services, which together account for 63% of the 484 billion shekel budget. These sectors present a massive opportunity—even minor improvements through AI could enhance the lives of millions of Israelis.</p><p>To illustrate the potential impact, consider how AI-driven educational tools could personalize learning experiences for Israeli students, improving outcomes by up to 30%, according to a 2024 OECD report. In city services, AI-powered traffic management systems could reduce congestion by 25%, significantly improving daily commutes. Meanwhile, AI-enabled hospital workflows could cut patient wait times by 50%, according to recent studies. Prioritizing projects in these areas ensures immediate benefits for individuals while setting a strong foundation for broader AI adoption.</p><h2>Training our future AI professionals</h2><p></p><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4D12AQGNClQN3y-gRg" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQGNClQN3y-gRg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737138600334?e=1753920000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=cRlyF67JzZ8otJJYwcnNDWLi0snWu7iYnJrsp7IBCPc"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>While Israel has gained global recognition as a "startup nation," its performance in international assessments like PISA and TIMSS reveals challenges in core subjects such as math and science. Despite these gaps, Israel’s innovative spirit and entrepreneurial culture have driven technological advancements, making the development of a robust AI education system both necessary and achievable.

This dual approach ensures broad accessibility while nurturing specialized talent among the most motivated students.</p><p>Practical initiatives like establishing AI education labs in high schools have already shown promise globally. For example, research published by the World Economic Forum highlights how schools in Estonia implemented AI-based tools to monitor student progress and customize teaching plans. This approach led to a measurable increase in engagement and test scores, particularly for students who were previously struggling. Programs like these demonstrate the potential for adapting international successes to the Israeli context, where such systems could address existing educational disparities while promoting innovation.</p><h2>Using our resources wisely</h2><figure><img data-media-urn="urn:li:digitalmediaAsset:D4D12AQHLbcu1nXtXfQ" src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQHLbcu1nXtXfQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737138649800?e=1753920000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=ivOMdBXaQs-pLuq6psqAmYSTaVe1H8UAcPyNWoAh8UM"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The government’s budget allocation tells a story of priorities, reflecting the fundamental commitment of a democratic government like Israel’s to prioritize the well-being of its citizens. Ensuring access to quality education, healthcare, and efficient city services underscores the role of AI as a transformative tool to enhance lives and strengthen public trust in these critical sectors. Education receives 148.9 billion shekels (30.8%), healthcare gets 97.83 billion shekels (20.2%), and city services account for 57 billion shekels (11.8%). These figures highlight areas where AI can make the greatest difference.</p><p>In education, personalized AI tutoring systems can close achievement gaps and support teachers by automating administrative tasks. For example, an AI-powered learning assistant deployed in rural schools in India showed a 25% improvement in math scores. Similarly, in city services, smart waste management systems like those used in Singapore reduced landfill contributions by 40%, demonstrating scalable success. Healthcare administration can benefit from AI systems that streamline appointment scheduling, saving patients and providers time.</p><p>Investing in these areas not only improves public services but also creates scalable solutions that private companies can adopt, fostering a virtuous cycle of innovation. Moreover, focusing on these sectors directly impacts people’s quality of life, ensuring that AI’s benefits are widely felt.</p><h2>Bringing AI efficiency</h2><p>A significant challenge lies in the stark disparity between salaries in the tech sector and those in essential public services like education and healthcare. While tech professionals earn an average of 30,126 shekels per month, workers in education and healthcare earn around 7,500 shekels. This gap reflects the government’s constrained ability to allocate resources effectively across critical sectors. As a result, the integration of AI is no longer optional but essential to improve efficiency, reduce resource wastage, and achieve more with limited budgets.</p><p>AI can help public services deliver better outcomes without a proportional increase in manpower. For instance, in education, AI-driven systems can automate administrative tasks, create personalized learning pathways, and identify at-risk students early for intervention. Similarly, in healthcare, predictive analytics and AI-powered diagnostic tools can optimize patient care, freeing up resources for critical areas. These technologies not only enhance service quality but also allow for reallocation of funds to raise salaries for essential workers, addressing the disparity in compensation.</p><p>To attract talent and ensure the sustainability of these improvements, public sector roles must be reimagined.
