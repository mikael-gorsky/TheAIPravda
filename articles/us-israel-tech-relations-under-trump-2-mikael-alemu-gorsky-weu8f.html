  <div><p>A roundtable discussion at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) following President Trump's second inauguration on January 22, 2025, brought together leading experts to analyze the future of Israel-US relations, with particular focus on technology and artificial intelligence. The discussion was part of INSS's U.S. Program and featured:</p><p>- Col. (ret.) Eldad Shavit - Senior researcher at INSS's U.S. Program</p><p>- Dr. Avishai Ben Sasson-Gordis - U.S. Policy Expert at INSS</p><p>- Hadas Lorber - International Relations and Technology Expert at INSS</p><p>The panel, representing INSS's leading research team on U.S.-Israel relations, provided comprehensive analysis of the technological and strategic implications of Trump's second term.</p><h2>ðŸ”¶ Strategic context</h2><p>Col. (ret.) Shavit opened the discussion by noting that Trump enters his second term "much more prepared and organized," with a clear worldview centered on "America First" and addressing the Chinese challenge. This frames the technological discussion, as Dr. Ben Sasson-Gordis emphasized that maintaining relationships "with more than one American group" will be crucial for Israel's long-term interests.</p><h2>ðŸ”· Technology as a strategic asset</h2><p>The most detailed technology analysis came from Hadas Lorber, INSS's expert on international technological cooperation, who outlined how technological cooperation will be central to Israel-US relations in this new era. According to Hadas Lorber, "Whoever controls global technology will control the world order." She emphasized that the competition between the US and China has shifted decisively into the technological realm, particularly in emerging technologies.</p><h2>ðŸ”¶ Israel's position and opportunities</h2><p>A key insight from the discussion is Israel's unique position as a technological bridge. As Hadas Lorber explained, "Israel is in a strategic position, first to strengthen ties with the U.S. in all worlds of research and development... where yes, we are still a 'start-up nation.'" This position becomes particularly important in the context of regional cooperation through the Abraham Accords.</p><p>The analysis highlighted several specific opportunities:</p><p>1. AI development and security: "Israel has the capabilities... in artificial intelligence worlds, cybersecurity worlds, collaboration in critical infrastructure cybersecurity, AI security, all the topic of 'protecting AI'".</p><p>2. Regional technology hub: Israeli technology companies can support initiatives like Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, particularly in AI development, positioning Israel as a key regional technology partner.</p><p>3. Critical infrastructure: Opportunities in renewable energy and cybersecurity for critical infrastructure.</p><h2>ðŸ”· Challenges and considerations</h2><p>The discussion highlighted several challenges that Israel must navigate:</p><p>1. Trust issues: Hadas Lorber pointed out that Israel is "only in the second tier, because of the problem of 'trusted technology,' that they still find it difficult to trust that we won't leak technologies to China".</p><p>2. Political balance: as Dr. Ben Sasson-Gordis noted, Israel must maintain its ability to work with various American political groups while deepening technological cooperation.</p><h2>ðŸ”¶ Strategic recommendations</h2><p>The roundtable concluded with several key recommendations for Israel:</p><p>1. Leverage the current favorable political environment (Republican Congress and administration) to establish and protect technological partnerships.</p><p>2. Focus on creating formalized agreements in technology, energy, and health sectors.</p><p>3. Position Israel clearly within the "American camp" while maintaining regional leadership.</p><p>4. Utilize the Abraham Accords framework to expand technological cooperation regionally.</p><h2>ðŸ”· Looking forward</h2><p>As Hadas Lorber concluded, "The more partnerships we secure together with a comfortable Congress and administration, the more it will help us against future administrations that might be much more negative." This suggests a strategic window of opportunity for Israel to cement its position as a key technological partner for the United States while expanding its regional influence through technological leadership.</p><p>The INSS analysis suggests that Israel's technological capabilities, particularly in AI and cybersecurity, will be crucial assets in maintaining and strengthening its relationship with the United States during Trump's second term, while also serving as a foundation for expanded regional cooperation.</p></div>
